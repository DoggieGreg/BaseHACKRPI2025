		description:
			"We used LLaVA, Whisper, and TTS to create a conversational, multimodal AI assistant for the visually impaired. Users provide images and questions, and the AI describes images and answers questions. This project places a camera above the user's left eye on a pair of glasses to take pictures of the world around the user. The user can summon the assistant by saying 'DAVE'. The user can ask DAVE to describe the image of the world around them. Alternatively, the user can ask DAVE questions about their surroundings. The camera takes a picture from its perspective. The user's speech is interpreted as text and combined with the image to prompt the model. The model provides an appropriate response to the user through speech.",

			"Ed-You is a web application that creates a direct channel for secure feedback from students about teachers to administration. Ed-You is catered to two main audiences: students and administrators. Students enter their school code, which is randomly generated and available to the admin in their school, and are able to choose from a list of teachers at their school and provide anonymous feedback whenever they want. The only restriction to student-feedback is toxicity: the application uses a fine-tuned large language model to flag any potentially harmful comments and force the student to reword them. On the administration side, admins can log in through Google OAuth to access their dashboard. A list of teachers from their school will be visible, and admins can click on any teacher to learn more about the feedback given to them. This feedback takes the form of an average rating calculated by another fine-tuned LLM, an AI-generated summary, and raw comments with time stamps.",
